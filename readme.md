# COMPUTER GRAPHICS

this are my personal notes on computer graphics course of professor Casciola Giulio

## HOW TO USE

- install [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
- [clone the repository](https://github.com/carnivuth/cpvision.git)
- [add the repo as obsidian vault](https://help.obsidian.md/Files+and+folders/Manage+vaults#Create+vault+from+an+existing+folder)

it's possible to use the repo without obsidian but in order to get the best experience you need to install it
